# SwiftGit2
![Swift 5.3.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.3.x-orange.svg)

Swift bindings to [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2).

```swift
let URL: URL = ...
let result = Repository.at(URL)
switch result {
case let .success(repo):
    let latestCommit = repo
        .HEAD()
        .flatMap {
            repo.commit($0.oid)
        }

    switch latestCommit {
    case let .success(commit):
        print("Latest Commit: \(commit.message) by \(commit.author.name)")

    case let .failure(error):
        print("Could not get commit: \(error)")
    }

case let .failure(error):
    print("Could not open repository: \(error)")
}
```

## Design
SwiftGit2 uses value objects wherever possible. That means using Swift’s `struct`s and `enum`s without holding references to libgit2 objects. This has a number of advantages:

1. Values can be used concurrently.
2. Consuming values won’t result in disk access.
3. Disk access can be contained to a smaller number of APIs.

This vastly simplifies the design of long-lived applications, which are the most common use case with Swift. Consequently, SwiftGit2 APIs don’t necessarily map 1-to-1 with libgit2 APIs.

All methods for reading from or writing to a repository are on SwiftGit’s only `class`: `Repository`. This highlights the failability and mutation of these methods, while freeing up all other instances to be immutable `struct`s and `enum`s.

## Adding SwiftGit2 to your Project
This fork of SwiftGit2 depends on the system installation of libgit2 (and potentially other libraries in the future such as libssh and libgpg). It is thus only available for developer use on desktop devices equipped with a package manager, or some other means of installing the required libraries as system dependencies.
